Week 1

Our group was formed, and we decided to do the MealMatch project. Our group discussed our
technology stack and tasked ourselves with creating user stories and epics for this week.
Gordon, David and I worked on the stories for the Recipe Explorer. At the end of the week,
our group has a call meeting to check through everyone's user stories and making sure our
user stories covered the project description and objectives sufficiently. We had a few
questions, one of them regarding a line in the project description. We will ask Xin (our
mentor) during the tutorial next week.
