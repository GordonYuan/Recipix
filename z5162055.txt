Week 1

Our group was formed, and we decided to do the MealMatch project. Our group discussed our
technology stack and tasked ourselves with creating user stories and epics for this week.
Gordon, David and I worked on the stories for the Recipe Explorer. At the end of the week,
our group has a call meeting to check through everyone's user stories and making sure our
user stories covered the project description and objectives sufficiently. We had a few
questions, one of them regarding a line in the project description. We will ask Xin (our
mentor) during the tutorial next week.

Week 2

I worked together with the rest of the group to form the basic storyboards. Everyone
except Andrew worked on the storyboards meanwhile Andrew worked on the system architecture
diagram.

Week 3

I wrote the background section for the project proposal as well as compiled the report
and provided some basic formatting. After submitting the proposal, our group discussed
how we would approach developing our web app.
