Week 1
We formed our group and decided that we were doing MealMatch as our project. We created our Jira page and discussed some technologies we
could use for our project. We decided (pending further exploration) to use Python+Flask,MySQL and React. We wrote the user stories for our
project but these may be subject to change later. The user stories have not been uploaded to Jira yet.

Gordon and I were responsible for the recipe contributor portion of the user stories. 

Week 2
Tuesday
From the lecture:
Business Layer - units of code that deal with business logic
Data Layer - units of code that deal with data persistence
Presentation Layer - units of code that deal with the interface presented to users.

Thursday (Lab)
We were confused about this sentence:

"The system must be able
to suggest a category for each ingredient added by contributors, based on categories previously associated on
other recipes with that ingredient."

Our tutor clarified:
Assuming the category of an entered ingredient is already in the database, the system will bring up the category upon the entry of the ingredient. This is enough to satisfy the specifications.

Extra features will be rewarded. You can't go over full marks but it may compensate for marks lost elsewhere.


We decided to do a UI design session together over the weekend (currently scheduled for Saturday). 

On Saturday, we spent some time designing the UI elements. We will need to have the proposal done by Sunday and that is our goal for this week. We're also not sure about how the feature of recommending sets of ingredients without a matching recipe is meant to be implemented so we'll need to ask our tutor about that. I will be helping with report writing and designing the remaining wireframes.
