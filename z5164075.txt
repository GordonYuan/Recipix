Week 1
We formed our group and decided that we were doing MealMatch as our project. We created our Jira page and discussed some technologies we
could use for our project. We decided (pending further exploration) to use Python+Flask,MySQL and React. We wrote the user stories for our
project but these may be subject to change later. The user stories have not been uploaded to Jira yet.

Gordon and I were responsible for the recipe contributor portion of the user stories.
