Week 1

Group was formed. Two meets were held during the latter half of the week to discuss the spec, the assessment criteria and overall thoughts 
on the project. The group came up with a list of user stories, which were polished over the 2nd meeting. I came up with two of those user
stories, and helped edit and go through the rest of them. The group discovered various difficulties/obscurities whilst reading through
the spec, and are prepared to clarify these issues in the week 2 lab. We have made rough decisions on our tech stack and preferences of 
roles in development.

Week 2

with the agenda to meet up on Saturday to discuss and work on the UI design and diagrams, as well as the report for the proposal.
