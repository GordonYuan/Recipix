Week 1

Group was formed. Two meets were held during the latter half of the week to discuss the spec, the assessment criteria and overall thoughts 
on the project. The group came up with a list of user stories, which were polished over the 2nd meeting. I came up with two of those user
stories, and helped edit and go through the rest of them. The group discovered various difficulties/obscurities whilst reading through
the spec, and are prepared to clarify these issues in the week 2 lab. We have made rough decisions on our tech stack and preferences of 
roles in development.

Week 2

Clarified various concerns in tutorial, split tasks with relation to all proposal specs. All members had a meeting after the tutorial, 
with the agenda to meet up on Saturday to discuss and work on the UI design and diagrams, as well as the report for the proposal. 

Saturday 
4 hour meeting on doing System architechture design diagram, confirming and clarifying ideas around implementation and features to
include, extra features, collaborative effort in using figma to construct UI storyboards. 


Week 3
Andrew and I are finalising user stories, will go through these with the group. Other members of the group are assigned different parts
of the proposal.

Saturday
User stories in relation to novel functionalities, finishing touches and revision over all user stories were done by Andrew and I over a
2 hour meeting. A lot of discussion went into fleshing out how the implementation for the system was going to be like, gaining a better
holistic overview of the system, etc. Lastly, we did a part of the report writing, which involved relating the user stories to the novel
functionalities, as well as explaining how the user stories contributed to project objectives

Sunday
A 4 hour meeting was took place, which finalised all our changes for the proposal by putting together all the different parts. I helped 
out by contributing the to discussion, deciding what novel features we should actually include in our proposal. Our goal for the meeting
is probably try to discuss in detail how to start on the coding, flesh out our understanding of how to implement our system in practice
further, so that everyone is on the same page before starting.

Week 4

Tuesday
2 and a half hour meeting to figure out the techstack, we brainstormed some of the HTTP requests, came up with a database schema, and managed to install various packages so 
everyone can get started. We started another github, acting as a sandbox for us to familiarise ourselves with various aspects of the techstack, and we figured its better to do
it this way rather than cluster up the main project github.
